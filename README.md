## Xtris

A toy Tetris clone in JavaScript, utilizing the HTML5 canvas.


## Requirements

Uses the canvas and some other relatively recent JavaScript APIs, so
requires a "modern" browser. Exact versions not checked.


## TODO

* make the restart button work
* dropping blocks all the way down when they're active with the down arrow
* pausing the game
* scoring games - counting points
* speeding up the game as it progresses
* UI polishing
* storing high scores
