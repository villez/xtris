## Xtris

A toy Tetris clone in JavaScript, utilizing the HTML5 canvas.


## Gameplay

Start/restart the game with the button below the game area.

Move the dropping pieces left and right with the arrow keys. Rotate
with up arrow. Drop the piece all the way down with the down arrow.

You can pause the game, and restart again, with the P key. 


## Requirements

Uses the canvas and some other relatively recent JavaScript APIs, so
requires a "modern" browser. Exact versions not checked.


## TODO

* scoring games - counting points
* speeding up the game as it progresses
* UI polishing
* storing high scores
